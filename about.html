    <h2>About Me</h2>
	 <p>
		I am a theoretical physicist broadly interested in the quantum structure of spacetime, black hole thermodynamics, and string theory. My research investigates how horizonless configurations—such as fuzzballs and extremely compact objects (ECOs)—can provide a more complete microscopic description of black holes and offer new perspectives on the information paradox. I also explore conformal field theory (CFT) approaches to understanding black hole microstates, particularly within the D1-D5-P system.
	 </p>
	  <p>
To connect theory with observation, I am developing expertise in gravitational wave physics, with the aim of identifying potential quantum gravity signatures in data from current and future detectors. As part of this effort, I will be working with the Heising-Simons Foundation as a postdoctoral researcher with the QuRIOS collaboration to further explore observational pathways to test fundamental ideas in quantum gravity.
</p><p>
I recently completed my PhD at The Ohio State University, where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Samir D. Mathur. My work focused on the microstate structure of black holes in string theory, their low-energy gravitational descriptions like ECOs and lifting of D1-D5-P  states. My research work can be found <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1964764">here</a>.
</p><p>
Originally from Jaipur, India, I received my integrated B.S.–M.S. degree in physics from IISER Bhopal. Beyond research, I am deeply interested in the broader implications of quantum gravity and the philosophical questions it raises about space, time, and the nature of reality. I engage in scientific outreach through writing and public communication, aiming to make advanced ideas in theoretical physics more accessible to a wider audience. I host a YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@timebeforespace">Time before Space</a>, where I share conceptual insights into gravity and quantum theory, and interview leading physicists about their work, motivations, and perspectives on foundational questions. Through this platform and my personal website, I hope to foster deeper curiosity and dialogue around the frontiers of fundamental physics.
    <p>
      This site serves as a hub for my work, ideas, and public writing.
